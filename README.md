# Logics: loops :loop: , conditionals :arrow_up_down:,  operators :heavy_plus_sign: and conventions. 

### Starting our logics with operators:

- Operators:

- "==": If equals;
- "!=": If different;
- "%": Module, resto of division;
- "+": Sum;
- "-": Subtract;
- "*": Multiply;
- "/": Division;



### Relational operators:

- if: If condition is true, do something. Else do another thing. (_Else is not required to be used, because if it will be false automatically "if" wont be executed_).

- else if: Conditional ">=", "<=", "<", ">"



### Logic operators:

- "&&": And, will verify only first term;
- "||": Our, will verify only first term;
- "&": And, but will verify all logic;
- "|": Our, and will verify all logic.

- "++before": Increment first and check expression after;
- "After++": Verify first and increment after.



### Conventions

- Package names: All lower case;

- Class names: First letter from each word is upper;
- Method names: First letter always lower case, if has more than one word first letter of second word will be upper case;
- Variables names: always lower case;



**Checkstyle**: Program which look for issues in conventions in  code.

**PMD:** Program which analyses the code for look for good practices.
